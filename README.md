# GettingCleaningData

Repo for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

## Course Project

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Making Modifications to This Script
Obtain the data and use ``downloader'' package to unzip. Set workding directory to the location of the source of files in own directory.


##Variables
Additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
